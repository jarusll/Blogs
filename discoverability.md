# Discoverability in Codebase
## What is it?
Code discoverability is how easy it is for a developer to find existing functionalities and dependent functionalities.

## How to rate discoverability
- How easy is to traverse indirections?
- How declarative is the business logic?
	- Declarative code describes "what" as opposed to imperative code which describes "how". It describes the code intent closer to business logic.

## How to achieve it?
### Code Browsers
	Code browsers index all the primitive components of codebase. It could be Classes or functions or any abstraction provided by the language.
	Some of the best code browsers I've used are the
#### Pharo's system browser

### Outliners
#### VSCode's Outline view
	I heavily use the outline view to have a birds eye on the file although its not as beneficial in React

### Regex
	Good'ol Grep/Ripgrep REGEX RULES!!!!!!
	Regex would be my last option along with data wrangling.

### Tag browser
	Tags generated by `ctags` can be used as well to navigate the codebase.


### Intuitive interfaces
	For functional programming It would be sensible function signatures like [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/).

	For OO It would be Interfaces. I believe you could search classes by receives and sends clause. Pharo's supports this.

- Visual Debuggers
	- Instead of providing the keyvalue pairs for debugging, IDEs could support visual debuggers which would be more intuitive.

Here's a [thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32365660) where I asked developers how they go about getting comfortable with a new codebase.
