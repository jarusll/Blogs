- What is a palindrome?
  - A string which is the same reversed

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    aba
    1234321
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    
- Is the first half a mirror image of second half?
  - Yes

- What is our purpose?
  - To find the longest palindrome
    
- Is a single chracter palindrome?
  - Yes 

- What is a trivial algorithm to find the longest palindrome?
  - Traverse the string
  - Expand from middle and check for palindrome
  - Note down the palindrome size
    
- For the assumed string =...abacdcaba...= what are the palindrome sizes?
  |-----------------+-----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-----|
  | String          | ... | a | b | a | c | d | c | a | b | a | ... |
  | Palindrome size | ... | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 9 |   |   |   |   |     |
  |-----------------+-----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-----|
  At this stage, these are the palindrome sizes of a slice in the string
  
- Can we use the fact that a palindrome is a mirror image?
  - Yes, which means the palindrome sizes of the right half are atleast the size on the left
  |-----------------+-----+---+---+---+---+---+------+------+------+------+-----|
  | String          | ... | a | b | a | c | d | c    | a    | b    | a    | ... |
  | Palindrome size | ... | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 9 | >= 1 | >= 1 | >= 3 | >= 1 | ... |
  |-----------------+-----+---+---+---+---+---+------+------+------+------+-----|
  
- Why are they atleast the size on the left?
  - Because there is a possibility that this palindrome might be a part of a longer palindrome

- Assuming that this slice of palindrome is a part of a longer palindrome, where should we look next for a palindrome?
