# What motivates me (I think)

2 things
- Variety
- Speed

## Variety
I have noticed about myself that I like heterogeneity whether it comes to programming or food or games. They are like flavours I want to try and I want to try all of them. It helps me grow as an individual. Its the same reason why I tried Object oriented programming when I was a hardcore functional programmer, why I mix my food unevenly so that every bite will taste different and why I explore every part of the game so that I don't miss out on an experience. Maybe its evolution playing that I am constantly on the hunt for something new.

## Speed
This one's easy, I just don't want to be slow. I have very limited time and I want to be good at my art which means being efficient. I am speedrunning experiences. It could be as simple as navigating my computer to planning my future. Its the same reason I use `i3wm` and remap every shortcut I can utilize to make my life easier. Its the same reason why I try to overengineer and abstract my code to keep it lean.

It turns out that everything I do in my life tries to maximize variety and minimize time.
