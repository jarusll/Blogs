# What motivates me (I think) 

2 things
- Variety
- Speed

## Variety
I have noticed about myself that I like heterogeneity whether it comes to programming or food or games. They are like flavours I want to try and I want to try all of them. It helps me grow as an individual. Its the same reason why I tried Object oriented programming when I was a hardcore functional programmer, why I mix my food unevenly so that every bite will taste different and why I explore every part of the game so that I don't miss out on an experience. Maybe its evolution playing that I am constantly on the hunt for something new.

## Speed
This one's easy, I just don't want to be slow. I want to be good at my art which means being efficient. I am speedrunning experiences.

I do believe that any form of extremism is bad. I try to be virtuous while balancing myself.
Being around passionate individuals motivates me as well.

Have a good one stranger.
