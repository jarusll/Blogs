# Why I made a public diary

I have kept things to myself all my life, because I found it hard to open up to people.
And that did not help. Communication is what makes us humans(probably).

I have definitely matured to open up.
Now, I try to be an open book. I want people to see me as me. I want them to know where I come from.

This diary will be my own corner. Also it'll help me keep track of things.

Have a good one stranger.
