# Desi Literate Programming in Bhailang

## What is Bhailang[^bhailang]?
According to its landing page, "A toy programming language written in Typescript".
Its a programming language based on Indian slangs, which makes it fun & accessible for anyone who knows Hindi.

## What is Literate Programming[^literate-programming]?
According to Donald Knuth, the creator of Literate programming, "Literate programming is a programming methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation language, making programs more robust, more portable, and more easily maintained than programs written only in a high-level language."

Simply put, its "Code inside Documentation" instead of "Documentation inside Code".

## Why Bhailang?
It doesn't adhere to literate programming's definition, but I guess you could call it poor man's literate programming language.

I do believe that code is meant to be read first and executed second. The fact that Bhailang makes reads like natural language makes it a good language for literate programming. 

Also according to the documentation, "`hi bhai` is the entrypoint for the program and all program must end with `bye bhai`. Anything outside of it will be ignored". Which means you can write things like documentation, problem statement and things related to the program anywhere outside the program body. 

## Sample programs 
I wont explain the syntax, its trivial. They are just syntactic sugars for programming constructs but accessible.
