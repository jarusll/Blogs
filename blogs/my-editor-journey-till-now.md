# My Editor Journey Till Now

## What did I start with?
**2018** 

My first editor was Emacs. Why did I choose emacs? I couldnt figure out how to exit vim. 

I got really into programming with Scheme. And I liked it so much I decided to choose the editor with its root in it.

I learnt to use emacs but never really learnt it. The power of emacs comes from extensibility. Although I am a casual lisp programmer, I never bothered to learn elisp and extend emacs to my liking.

## Why did I switch?
**2020**

The elisp configs dint make any sense. The packages and I felt slow in emacs. Although I am partly to be blame for not harnessing its power.

I decided to switch to Vim in 2020.
I like that just about any action is 1-3+ click/s away. I felt fast, really fast.
I felt so fast that I started using it everywhere. I use Vimium in my browser.
I use i3wm which has vim-like keybinds. I use vim keybinds in online ides for prototyping. I wish it was everywhere.

## Why I am switching again?
**2022**
I have recently been tinkering with smalltalk. The Pharo(or any smalltalk) IDE has been one of the best IDEs I have ever used. I know when I miss vim because I feel slow. But I never felt slow in Pharo's IDE. Its because you are able to reach just about anywhere within few clicks. I realised I was getting more done and was managing very less code. It made me think about extensibility. 

And this made me change my mind. Its about time I did emacs properly.

## What do I plan to achieve?
One day I will start my day by opening emacs and I'll end it by closing emacs.
This is what I am aiming for.

## What now?
I will use vim for quick edits. I will continue using it in my browser. Emacs support in browser is not functional.
