# Desi Literate Programming in Bhailang

## What is Bhailang?
According to its landing page, "A toy programming language written in Typescript".
Its a programming language based on Indian slangs, which makes it fun & accessible for anyone who knows Hindi.

## What is Literate Programming?
Instead of "Documentation inside Code", its "Code inside Documentation"

## Why Bhailang?
I believe that code is meant to be read first and executed second. The fact that Bhailang makes reads like natural language makes it a good language for literate programming. 

Also according to the documentation, "`hi bhai` is the entrypoint for the program and all program must end with `bye bhai`". Anything outside of it will be ignored. Which means you can write things like documentation, problem statement and things related to the program anywhere outside the program body.
