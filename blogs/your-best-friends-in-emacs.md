# decribe-* functions: Your best friends in Emacs

## In emacs, You are either
- Invoking a function through a key press
- Invoking a function manually

## Describe Mode `C-h m`
Describe mode gives you a list of all enabled Minor modes, functions in the major mode & all their key binds.

### How I use it?
I usually keep a window on my bottom right corner for `describe-mode`. I skim through it for the first time. If I notice myself repeating an action, I'll lookup if there's a function/keybind for that action. After using it for a while, it becomes second nature.

## Describe Key `C-h k`
Describe key gives you the command associated with the key/chord in current mode.

## Why best friends?
I believe that one of the biggest difference between a professional and a begginer is that the professional has gotten comfortable in an environment which is pretty hostile to them.

If you foster exploration for yourself, you can get comfortable really fast. 

## What about other describe-* functions?
You can look at it yourself. These 2 functions will help you explore every part of emacs.

Godspeed
