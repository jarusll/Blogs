# Your best friends in Emacs

## In emacs, You are either
- Invoking a function through a key press
- Invoking a function manually

## Describe Mode `C-h m`
Describe mode gives you a list of all enabled Minor modes, functions in the major mode & all their key binds.

I skim through `describe-mode` the first time I am using a mode. 

## Describe Function `C-h f`
Describe function brings up the documentation about a function by name.

I use this almost everytime to find out about a function.

## Describe Key `C-h k`
Describe key gives you the command associated with the key/chord in current mode.

## Describe Variable `C-h v`
Describe variable brings up the documentation about a variable by name.

## Why best friends?
I believe that one of the biggest difference between a professional and a begginer is that the professional has gotten comfortable in an environment which is pretty hostile to them.

If you foster exploration for yourself, you can get comfortable really fast. 

## What about other describe-* functions?
You can look at it yourself. These 2 functions will help you explore every part of emacs.

Godspeed
