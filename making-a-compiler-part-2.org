- What are primitive operations?
  - The most basic building blocks which can be composed to make bigger building blocks
    
- What primitives are we building for our language?
  - Calculator and a List Processor
    
- What operations does a Calculator support?
  - =Negation= -> =- Number=
  - =Groupings= -> =( <Expression> )=
  - =Additives= -> =+= | =-=
  - =Multiplicatives= -> =*= | =/=
  - =Exponents= -> =^=

    We will also support Comparatives & Booleans for our language
  - =Comparatives= -> =>= | =<= | => == | =< == | ==== | =! ==
  # - =Booleans= -> =and= | =or= | =not=
  
- Does the order matter in =a + b + c=?
  - No, =(a + b) + c= is equal to =a + (b + c)=

- How about =a + b * c=?
  - Yes, =a + (b * c)= is the correct order
    
- What is the operator precedence in Math?
  - Groupings then Exponents then Multiplicatives then Additives
    
- Lets tabulate it for our language
  - The precedence is from top to bottom. Our language will support Comparatives and Booleans as well
    
    | Negation        |
    | Groupings       |
    | Exponents       |
    | Multiplicatives |
    | Additives       |
    | Comparatives    |
    | Booleans        |

- How can we express operator precedence for our language?
  - EBNF notation
    
- For brevity, assuming our language only supports Multiplicatives and Additives, how can we process all the multiplicatives before the additives?

  *ASSUMPTION BEGIN*

  - By specifying the exact same

  #+BEGIN_SRC bnf
  input -> additive
  additive -> multiplicative additive_operator multiplicative
  additive_operator -> "+" | "-"
  #+END_SRC

  Additive will pass the execution to Multiplicatives. When Multiplicatives are done executing and return the result, additives will execute itself

  - How do we solve multiplicatives?
    - Solving multiplicatives should be easy since the operands will be primitives(For the assumed case ie language only supporting additives & multiplicatives)

    #+BEGIN_SRC bnf
    multiplicative -> number multiplicative_operator number
    multiplicative_operator -> "*" | "/"
    #+END_SRC
    
    - How will this grammar generate the tree for the expression =1 * 4 + 7 / 9=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1 * 4 + 7 / 9 => Additive => Multiplicative Additive_Operator Multiplicative
├── 1 * 4 => Multiplicative => Number Multiplicative_Operator Number
│   ├── 1 
│   ├── *
│   └── 4
├── +
└── 7 / 9 => Multiplicative => Number Multiplicative_Operator Number 
    ├── 7
    ├── /
    └── 9
#+END_EXAMPLE
    
    - How about =1 * 4 + 7=?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
7 / 1 + 8 => Additive => Multiplicative Additive_Operator Multiplicative
├── 7 / 1 => Multiplicative => Number Multiplicative_Operator Number
│   ├── 7
│   ├── /
│   └── 1
├── +
└── 8 => ?
#+END_EXAMPLE
      - We hit a roadblock

    - How do we resolve this?
      - By expressing single primitive in grammar
      
  - How can we do that?
    - By redefining the operations to support single argument
    #+BEGIN_SRC bnf
    additive -> multiplicative additive_operator multiplicative | multiplicative
    multiplicative -> number multiplicative_operator number | number
    #+END_SRC

    - Continuing execution

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
7 / 1 + 8 => Additive => Multiplicative Additive_Operator Multiplicative
├── 7 / 1 => Multiplicative => Number Multiplicative_Operator Number
│   ├── 7
│   ├── /
│   └── 1
├── +
└── 8 => Additive => Multiplicative => Number
#+END_EXAMPLE

  *ASSUMPTION END*
  
  *From the above example*
  - Will a low priority operation include the next high priority operation?
    - Yes, since the high priority operation will resolve itself before the one with lower priority

  - Does that mean the lowest priority operation will be the entrypoint?
    - Yes
      
  - What about the highest priority operations?
    - They will be the termination point

    | Negation        |
    | Groupings       |
    | Exponents       |
    | Multiplicatives |
    | Additives       |
    | Comparatives    |
    | Booleans        |

    Using the previous observations
    
    An expression could be either unary or binary
    #+BEGIN_SRC bnf
    expression -> unary | binary
    #+END_SRC
    Unary has more priority than binary
    
    Unary operations are
    #+BEGIN_SRC bnf
    unary -> negation | grouping | number
    negation -> "-" number
    grouping -> "(" expression ")"
    number -> [0-9]:+
    #+END_SRC

    Binary operations could be additive or comparative cascading from Comparative => Additive => Multiplicative => Exponent and back to Unary
    #+BEGIN_SRC bnf
    binary -> additive | comparative
    comparative -> additive comparative_op additive | additive
    comparative_op -> ">" | "<"
    additive -> multiplicative additive_op multiplicative | multiplicative
    additive_op -> "+" | "-"
    multiplicative -> exponent multiplicative_op exponent | exponent
    exponent -> unary "^" unary | unary
    #+END_SRC

- What operations does a List Processor support?
  - First -> Returns the first elements
  - Rest -> Returns everything but first element
  - Cons -> Adds an element to the head of the list
    
- Could you give an example?
  - First . [a, b,...] => a
  - Rest -> [a, b,...] => [b,...]
  - Cons z [a, b,...] => [z, a, b,...]
    
- Whats the First of an empty list?
  - We don't ask that

- Whats the Rest of an empty list?
  - We don't ask that as well

- So how can we represent List processor operations?
  #+BEGIN_SRC bnf
  List_op -> First | Rest | Cons
  First -> "first" array
  Rest -> "rest" array
  Cons -> "cons" array
  #+END_SRC
